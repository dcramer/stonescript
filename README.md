StoneScripts for my StoneStoryRPG
================================================

Based on https://github.com/TheMatjaz/StoneScript

Usage
----------------------------------------

1. Clone this repository into a subfolder of the StoneScript directory (\*)
   called `my`. On Windows the directory is:
   
   ```text
   %AppData%\LocalLow\Martian Rex, Inc_\Stone Story\<Steam ID>\Stonescript
   ```
   
   The cloning command should thus look like
   
   ```bash
   cd %AppData%\LocalLow\Martian Rex, Inc_\Stone Story\<Steam ID>\Stonescript
   git clone https://github.com/TheMatjaz/StoneScript.git my
   ```

2. Copy-paste the content of the
  [mindstone.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheMatjaz/StoneScript/master/mindstone.txt)
  file into the in-game Mindstone UI. This will load all other sub-scripts,
  one per level.

3. Modify the scripts as you please for your own playing.
   Hold TAB for debug information while playing a level.
